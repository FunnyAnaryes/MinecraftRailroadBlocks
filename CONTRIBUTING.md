You can also [create an issue](https://github.com/SamTheGamer39/MinecraftRailroadBlocks/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature-request.md&title=).
This is primarily for things like version and mod loader support. More general ideas like adding features for a specific
mod or new types of blocks should be placed in the [Ideas discussion](https://github.com/SamTheGamer39/MinecraftRailroadBlocks/discussions/categories/ideas).

## Pull Requests
If you've made changes to the mod you'd like to share with others, you can make a pull request.
Your pull request should increase a basic description of the proposed changes and any necessary links. It should also be
well-documented.

Additionally, you should follow these general guidelines:

- Smaller is better! Avoid making large pull requests. Ideally, a pull request should only add one feature or fix one
bug.
- Your code should be well documented with comments and JavaDoc where reasonable. At a minimum all classes and functions
should be commented.
- Follow any relevant coding styles and conventions.
- [Resolve any merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github).
- No personal information should be in your code (except for your name or username).

[MIT License](/LICENSE) for this mod. Additionally, you indicate that your contributions are in compliance with the
